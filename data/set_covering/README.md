E-Graphs converted from minimum set cover problem according to method mentioned in the [blog](https://effect.systems/blog/egraph-extraction.html).
The set cover dataset is [Frequent Itemset Mining
Dataset Repository](http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/).

This dataset was originally used in [SmoothE: A differentiable E-Graph Extraction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3669940.3707262).
